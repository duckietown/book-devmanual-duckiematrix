Inside the Duckiematrix
```

The `Duckiematrix` is a 3D simulator engine for Duckietown.
The name is born from the combination of "Duckietown" and "The Matrix", and as in the
science fiction action film series, this 3D engine aims at reproducing the physics and
aesthetics of a physical Duckietown environment with high fidelity.

But the `Duckiematrix` is not just a Duckiebot's simulator, oh no.
It is much more than that. One of its many uses can be that of simulating sensing and
acting of a Duckiebot in a Duckietown. But this is just a special case, a rather simple
one.
