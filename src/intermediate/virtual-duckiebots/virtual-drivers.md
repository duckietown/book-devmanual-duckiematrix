## Virtual Drivers I/O Diagram

In the following diagram we show what type of data each of the drivers receives or sends to the Duckiematrix:

```{figure} ../../_images/intermediate/virtual-drivers.png
:name: virtual-drivers-exchanged-objects

Data types exchanged with the Duckiematrix by the virtual drivers.
```

The interfaces are developed using the Python SDK, detailed in [](python-sdk).
